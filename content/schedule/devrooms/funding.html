<p>The "Funding the FOSS Ecosystem" devroom wants to bring together developers, maintainers, policymakers, entrepreneurs, donors and funders to explore various getting paid models and mechanisms that ensure the longevity and security of FOSS projects.</p>
<p>The goal of this devroom is for developers gain insights into funding strategies, their feasibility, and communication with end-users, while funders and broader entities like companies, governments, civil society and inter-governmental organisations are encouraged to better understand and support developer needs in FOSS projects.</p>
