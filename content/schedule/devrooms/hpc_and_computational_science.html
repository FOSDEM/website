<p>
  The High-Performance Computing (HPC) and Computational Science devroom provides an opportunity for open source
  software developers in the HPC community to present their work and discuss it with FOSDEM attendees.
</p>

<p>
   We invite system administrators, user support team members and end users of HPC infrastructure to participate
   and present their open source software project(s).</br>
   Topics include tools relevant to the HPC community (large-scale system administration, scalable technologies, user
   support), scientific software projects, etc., that adhere to the 'open source' format in some way or another.
</p>

<p>
  The devroom organisation is taken care of by the <a href="http://www.ugent.be/hpc/en">HPC team of Ghent University</a>
  (<a href="http://twitter.com/HPCUGent">@HPCUGent</a>), in collaboration with the
  <a href="https://vscentrum.be/nl/en">Flemish Supercomputer Centre (VSC)</a>.
