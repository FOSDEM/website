  Microkernels and component-based operating systems are pervasive
  parts of our computing landscape. They are currently used in
  situations where security and reliability are of utmost importance
  or where resources are scarce. The microkernel devroom brings the
  heads behind several projects together and offers a chance to get up
  to speed with developments in different groups.

  Organization of the microkernel devroom is done in turns by groups
  in the microkernel community. This year's devroom is organized by
  the <a href="http://os.inf.tu-dresden.de/">OS group of TU
  Dresden</a>.
