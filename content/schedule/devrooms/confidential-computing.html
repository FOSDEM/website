  This devroom is devoted to the emerging open-source ecosystem around Confidential Computing, also known as Hardware-aided Trusted Computing or Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) which make use of modern hardware extensions like Intel SGX/TDX, ARM TrustZone/CCA, AMD SEV/SNP and others. 
  Hence, with today's mainstream consumer hardware being increasingly shipped with these advanced trusted computing technologies, this devroom wants to foster discussion on the much-needed free and open-source TEE ecosystem amongst industry players, academics, enthusiasts, hobbyists, and project maintainers.
  The devroomâ€™s topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Free and open source confidential computing</li>
  <li>Programming frameworks for TEEs: how to develop free and open-source software that can run inside enclaves (e.g., library OSs, SDKs, Linux kernel support, etc.).</li>
  <li>Confidential computing deployment: Challenges and benefits</li>
  <li> Use cases and applications on top of TEEs such as applying confidential computing to the Cloud Native space</li>
  <li> Compiler and language support for emerging trusted hardware extensions</li>
  <li> Open-source enclave processor designs (e.g., RISC-V TEEs)</li>
  <li> Attestation, also across different technologies</li>
  <li> Existing technologies:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>What do they have in common, how do they differ?</li>
  <li>Which confidential computing use cases can they cover?</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Upcoming technologies:</li>
  <ul>
  <li>TEEs on accelerators (GPUs, NPUs, DPUs, etc)</li>
  <li>Interaction between existing and upcoming technologies</li>
  <li>Opportunities</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Vision: future TEEs (what is missed, proposals, wishes, discussions).</li>
  <li>TEE-specific attacks and defenses: reverse engineering, side-channels, vulnerabilities, exploits.</li>
</ul>
