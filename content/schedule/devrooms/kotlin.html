Kotlin is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)">cit. Wikipedia</a>). Currently developed and supported by JetBrains, Kotlin has been awarded Breakout Project of the Year at <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/07/kotlin-wins-breakout-project-of-the-year-award-at-oscon-19/">OSCON ’19</a> and its popularity has been skyrocketing in the last years.

Since its release, the language has been used by developers to write a variety of software: from Android apps to backend services, from native code to web applications. In 2020, the Kotlin ecosystem evolved to embrace multiplatform development with projects like Jetpack Compose Desktop and KMM (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile). The Kotlin developer community is really active online to build open source libraries, tools, and educational resources to support the evolution of the language.
