<a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> is a cross-platform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language with type inference (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotlin_(programming_language)">cit. Wikipedia</a>). Currently developed and supported by JetBrains, Kotlin has been awarded Breakout Project of the Year at <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2019/07/kotlin-wins-breakout-project-of-the-year-award-at-oscon-19/">OSCON ’19</a> and its popularity has been skyrocketing in the last years.
</p>
<p>
Since its release, the language has been used by developers to write a variety of software: from Android apps to backend services, from native code to web applications. The Kotlin developer community is really active online to build open source libraries, tools, and educational resources to support the evolution of the language. Since 2017, Kotlin has also been <a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2017/05/kotlin-on-android-now-official/">officially supported for Android development</a>, and in 2019 Google designated Kotlin the preferred language for Android development.
