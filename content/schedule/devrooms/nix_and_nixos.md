[Nix and NixOS](https://nixos.org/) are tools that take a unique
approach to package management and system configuration. It differs
with most other tools in that it is heavily inspired by functional
programming. Those inspirations being: immutable, side effectless, and
correct. It delivers on the promise of “if it works on my machine, it
will work on yours”. Without shipping your actual machine. 😉

The Nix and NixOS devroom will present interesting tools, projects,
features, and much more, within the Nix ecosystem. All by and for the
Nix community!
