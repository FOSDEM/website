  This devroom is devoted to the emerging open-source ecosystem around Confidential Computing, also known as Hardware-aided Trusted Computing or Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) which make use of modern hardware extensions like Intel SGX/TDX, ARM TrustZone/CCA, AMD SEV/SNP and others. With today's mainstream consumer hardware being increasingly shipped with these advanced trusted computing technologies, the devroom wants to foster discussion on the much-needed open-source TEE ecosystem amongst open-source hobbyists, academics, enthusiasts, and project maintainers. The devroom’s topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Free and open source confidential computing</li>
  <li>Programming frameworks for TEEs (how best to program and use TEEs)</li>
  <li>Attestation in confidential computing</li>
    <li>Compiler and language support</li>
    <li>Free and open source enclave processor designs (e.g., RISC-V TEEs)</li>
    <li>Applying Confidential Computing to the Cloud Native space</li>
    <li>Confidential Computing Deployment</li>
    <li>TEE-specific attacks and defenses: reverse engineering, side-channels, vulnerabilities, exploits</li>
    <li>Vision: Future TEEs (what is missed, proposals, wishes, discussions)</li>
    <li>Confidential Computing and trust</li>
  </ul>
  
<p>⚠️ This is a hybrid devroom. The Saturday program will be <b>online</b> and the Sunday program will be <b>on-campus</b> ⚠️.</p>
