<p>
  This devroom dedicated to everyone developing public code - open source code that implements public policy, used for the public good, and by public organizations like governments, public administrations and state corporations.
</p>
<p>
  We are looking for contributions that would fit within the main theme of the devroom. Below are some questions that could inspire your proposal:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>have you tried to replicate and/or co-develop with another public organization? what did you learn along the way?
  <li>do you have any procurement and/or governance models (or hacks!) that helped you use, reuse and co-develop public code or digital public goods?
  <li>are you working on and/or using some awesome public code or digital public good that has the potential for reuse, and the world needs to hear about?
</ul>

<p>
  If you have another idea for a talk that you think would fit, please don't hesitate to let us know! We hope that this will be an opportunity for everyone to meet and exchange ideas about public code and digital public goods around the world.
