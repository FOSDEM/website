<a href="https://nixos.org">Nix and NixOS</a> are tools that take a unique
approach to package management and system configuration. It differs
with most other tools in that it is heavily inspired by functional
programming. Those inspirations being: immutable, side effectless, and
correct. It delivers on the promise of &quot;if it works on my machine, it
will work on yours&quot;. Without shipping your actual machine. ðŸ˜‰</p>

<p>
The Nix and NixOS devroom will present interesting tools, projects,
features, and much more, within the Nix ecosystem. All by and for the
Nix community!</p>
