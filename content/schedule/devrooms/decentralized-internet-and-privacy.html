<p>The Internet landscape is evermore on it’s steadfast course towards surveillance and centralization. In this scenario, where most Internet connected devices have become tools of imprisonment rather than liberation, reviving the old Internet ethos of peer-to-peer (P2P) and private communication is of uttermost importance.</p>
<p>The Decentralized Internet and Privacy Devroom features talks from all technical projects and initiatives which foster decentralization and privacy on the Internet, or try to replace it for something new altogether. We also welcome those working on securing the devices, operating systems and user-facing software we use to access The Net.</p>
