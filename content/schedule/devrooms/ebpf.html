  eBPF is a technology that runs sandboxed programs in a privileged context,
  such as the operating system kernel. Use it to safely and efficiently extend
  the capabilities of the kernel, without changing kernel source code or
  loading kernel modules. Originally developed for the Linux kernel, eBPF now
  runs on other platforms, too. For more information on eBPF, see the
  <a href="https://ebpf.io">https://ebpf.io</a> website, or the
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EBPF">eBPF page on Wikipedia</a>.
