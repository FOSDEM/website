The purpose of this devroom is to discuss developing databases that are designed to
take advantage of the cloud native architecture in order to meet the
demands of modern applications.

Instead of focusing on a single technology or community, our goal is to
bring open source database communities and developers together to share
their experience, learn from their work, and foster collaboration on
challenges ahead.
