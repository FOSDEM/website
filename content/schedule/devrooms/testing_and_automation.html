<p>
This room is about building better
software through a focus on testing and automation at all layers of
the stack. From creating libraries and end-user applications all the
way down to packaging, distribution and deployment. Testing and
automation is not isolated to a single toolchain, language or
platform, there is much to learn and share regardless of background!
</p>

<p>
This year the Testing and Automation devroom will host both lower level topics:
hardware, bootloader, kernel as well as higher level topics: CI/CD, testing techniques,
libraries and frameworks.
</p>

<p>
This is the place where open source projects can share their
"testing from the trenches" stories!
