The Distributed Web devroom is a place for folks to learn about and play with open source frameworks and protocols for building peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed applications. Sessions will include demos, presentations, panels, Q&As, hands-on learning opportunities, facilitated experiences, networking spaces, on-boarding sessions, and discussions of connection points between frameworks/protocols.

lockchain technology is an emerging field of research that has already
seen many applications in the private and public sector. The most
obvious and visible ones are cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum but many
others projects ranging from logistics, supply chain management,
identity management, code archive use this technology as basic build
block to ensure redundancy, security, immutability. Free Software and Open source
plays an essential role in the development of blockchains and it is
important to attract the attention of developers and researchers.


This year presentations will range from new and emerging post-blockchain
