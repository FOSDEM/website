The Beyond Blockchain - Distributed Web Devroom is a place to learn about and play with the open source infrastructure of the new internet. An emerging internet that is distributed, peer-to-peer, and secure. (Learn more here!)[https://github.com/MorvinBear/Fosdem-Beyond-Blockchain-CfP]
 
Our content supports the DWeb values: distributed > decentralized, data sovereignty, security, privacy, censorship-resistance, and generally being cool as humans. 
 
Sessions may include:
* Q&As
* demos
* panels
* workshops
* presentations
* on-boarding sessions
* hands-on learning opportunities
* talks that are maybe kind of weird and fun
* inspiring multimedia arty experience for devs to “get” the distributed web
