<p>You will find talks related to <a href="https://www.mysql.com/products/community/">MySQL</a>, the world's most popular open source database.

<p>And finally, <a href="https://www.percona.com/software/mysql-database/percona-server">Percona Server</a>, also a fork of MySQL maintaining compatibility, is also discussed in the MySQL, MariaDB & Friends devroom.</p>
<p>Of course others open source products in the ecosystem of these open source databases have their place in the schedule as you can see !</p>
