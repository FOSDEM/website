    <b>FOSDEM 2020 Software Defined Networking devroom</b>
</p>
<p>
    The FOSDEM SDN devroom hosts a diversity of talks covering open source
    networking projects and technologies. Software Defined Networking continues
    to be an exciting, growing and diverse field.
</p>
<p>
    We typically have talks on a variety of SDN topics, including virtual
    switching, dataplace performance, open source SDN controllers, virtual
    routing (i.e. how you move the packets). We also have talks from the
    distinct, but closely related field of Network Functions Virtualisation (NFV),
    including open source NFV platforms, network functions and applications
    (i.e. why you move the packets).
