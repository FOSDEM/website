Over the past 10 years, the cost of radio front ends for computers has
declined to the point where anyone with a computer can afford a simple
radio front end. The flexibility of software combined with lower cost
radio hardware led to an explosion of interest in SDR among enthusiasts 
and in industry.

The Free Software Radio devroom has talks about frameworks, research projects,
applications, hardware, and tools. This is the place for Open Source SDR
developers to meet, exchange ideas, and start working together to
