<p>Over the past two decades, biology has been transformed by high-throughput technologies that generate vast amounts of data. This revolution created demand for efficient algorithms, parallel computing infrastructures (GPUs, HPC, cloud platforms), and sophisticated software tools. Open-source software is integral to this landscape.</p>

<p>Bioinformatics bridges engineering, computer science, and biology: genomics, medical imaging, AI-driven protein research… any field at the intersection of the Life Sciences and technology that has a FOSS angle. This devroom focuses on sharing and collaboration in the life sciences, from best practices in software engineering and UX to AI &amp; Machine Learning applications.</p>
