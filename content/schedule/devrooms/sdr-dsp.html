The software defined radio/digital signal processing (SDR/DSP) devroom
addresses discrete time (radiofrequency) signal processing including
digital communication, channel characterization, navigation and positioning, 
target ranging and velocity measurement, and signal characteristics extraction 
from raw IQ samples collected from single or multiple antennas. Software and 
hardware challenges are tackled.
