<p>20 years after the first X.org DevRoom at FOSDEM 2006, this is the 16th Graphics DevRoom at FOSDEM.</p>

<p>The talk topics of the graphics devroom encompass:
  <ul>
    <li>graphics drivers: display, 2d engines, 3d engines, at bootloader, kernel and userspace levels.</li>
    <li>media/video drivers: camera/capture engines, hardware media encoders and decoders on all levels.</li>
    <li>input drivers for bootloaders, kernels and userspace.</li>
    <li>windowing systems (X, wayland, surfaceflinger, others) and window managers.</li>
    <li>graphics toolkits (QT, GTK, others).</li>
    <li>3D and Compute APIs (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX, others), and 3d and game engines.</li>
    <li>Virtual reality hardware and toolkits.</li>
    <li>Artificial Intelligence HW acceleration.</li>
    <li>Media encode and decode applications.</li>
</ul>
And the tools needed to help configure and run the above.</p>
