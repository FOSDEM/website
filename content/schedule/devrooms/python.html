<p>
  Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language.
  Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows
  programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be
  possible in other languages. The language provides constructs intended to
  make clear programs possible on both a small and large scale.
