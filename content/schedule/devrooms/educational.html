The former FOSS Educational Programming Languages Devroom has been renamed to Educational Devroom. While previous years primarily focused on programming languages, we would like to broaden the scope of this devroom to include open source learning tools and concepts in education. 

We welcome presentations discussing topics such as programming languages and environments, coding competitions, educational foundations, learning materials, learning management systems, and more. It is important to remember that free software is both a movement and an idea. These ideas can be expressed by creating and contributing to open-source software, as well as how you choose to educate people about technology.
