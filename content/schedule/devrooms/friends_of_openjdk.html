Welcome to Foojay, <a href="https://foojay.io">a place for friends of OpenJDK</a>. 
Foojay is a community around the OpenJDK, providing tips and insights for Java developers,
providing user-focused Java and OpenJDK technical dashboards with free data on all things Java,
including a blog area, <a href="https://foojay.io/today>Foojay Today</a>.

<p>
The Foojay devroom at FOSDEM is an opportunity for developers in this domain to meet, 
discuss the current state of their projects, and their roadmaps, while also helping others
to understand the state of these interrelated projects.

Please join us, regardless of whether you are a core hacker, a plugin hacker, a user, 
a packager, or a hacker on a project that integrates, extends, or complements anything related to the OpenJDK.

<p>
Onwards to a united approach to helping developers get the most out of the OpenJDK!
