<h3>About Microkernels</h3>
<p>
Microkernels are kernels that provide only simple generic mechanisms
suitable for outsourcing the traditional operating-system functionality to
deprivileged user-mode processes in a component-based OS that runs on top. 
Microkernel-based operating systems come in many different flavors, each
having a distinctive set of goals, features, mechanisms and trade-offs. 
Some of the most frequently cited reasons for structuring the system as a
microkernel are security, modularity, flexibility, verifiability and
fault tolerance. Many microkernels can also act as a hypervisor.

<h3>About the Devroom</h3>
<p>
The microkernel and component-based OS devroom brings the creative minds
behind several open-source projects together and offers enthusiasts a chance
to discuss novel ideas and get up to speed with the latest developments in
the various groups.
Since the first Microkernel OS Devroom at FOSDEM 2012, this devroom has been
a part of each following FOSDEM (with slight variations of the name).
The focus gradually widened to include component-based, unikernel-based and
other operating systems.
