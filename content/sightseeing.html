  FOSDEM hires professional guides each year to offer free
  guided tours of Brussels to the spouses/partners of FOSDEM visitors.
  If your partner would like to accompany you to Brussels but is not interested
  in the FOSDEM conference, this will make their stay worthwhile.
  Brussels has a rich historical past and a cosmopolitan present.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>free tours</em> will take place on both days during the conference.
  Each tour will give you a view of a different side of the city, and the tours
  offered this year will be different from those offered in previous years.
</p>
  
<p>
  The meeting point is in the hallway of the UD building, and the tours end here as well.
  For both tours, Saturday and Sunday, you have to register in front providing phone number and e-mail.
  Send an e-mail to tour@fosdem.org providing name, e-mail and phone number and await a confirmation.
  We need this information for emergencies and won't use it or store it for any other purpose.
  It will be deleted after FOSDEM ends.
</p>

<p> 
  Come to the meeting point ON TIME. If you are to late we sadly can't wait for you!
  We go to the city centre by public transport kindly offered by FOSDEM.
</p>

<P>
  From there the tour guide will take you on a discovery tour through Brussels.
</p>

<p>
