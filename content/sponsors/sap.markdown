SAP is one of the world's leading producers of software for business process management.
Founded in 1972, SAP has grown from a small startup with five people to a multinational
with more than 105,000 employees worldwide, headquartered in Walldorf, Germany.

With its original SAP R/2 and R/3 software, SAP set the global standard for ERP software
(enterprise resource planning). Today, SAP S/4HANA takes ERP to the next level by
leveraging the power of in-memory computing to process enormous amounts of data and
support advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning.

The company's integrated applications connect all business functions into an intelligent
suite on a fully digital platform. Today, SAP has more than 230 million cloud users,
over 100 solutions for all business functions, and the largest cloud portfolio of all
providers.

SAP supports the event financially.
