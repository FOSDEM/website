Cisco enables people to make powerful connections - whether in business,
education, philanthropy, or creativity.
Cisco hardware, software, and service offerings are used to create the Internet
solutions that make networks possible - providing easy access to information
anywhere, at any time.

Cisco was founded in 1984 by a small group of computer scientists from Stanford
University. Since the company's inception, Cisco engineers have been leaders in
the development of Internet Protocol (IP)-based networking technologies.

Today, with more than 67,000 employees worldwide, this tradition of innovation
continues with industry-leading products and solutions in the company's core
development areas of routing and switching, as well as in advanced technologies
such as Application Networking, Data Center, Digital Media, IPICS, Mobility,
Security, Storage Networking, TelePresence, Unified Communications, Video and
Virtualization

Cisco provides all of our WLAN hardware and helps us setting up the wireless
network.
