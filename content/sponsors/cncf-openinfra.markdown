The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is an open source
software foundation dedicated to making cloud native computing
universal and sustainable. Cloud native computing uses an open source
software stack to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each
part into its own container, and dynamically orchestrating those
containers to optimize resource utilization. We host and nurture
components of cloud native software stacks, including Kubernetes,
Envoy and Prometheus. Come and meet the CNCF team at stand 2 on level
2 of the K building.

The OpenInfra Foundation, a project of The Linux Foundation, builds
open source communities who write software that runs in production. The
OpenInfra Foundation serves developers, operators and the entire open
infrastructure ecosystem by providing a set of shared resources to
build community, facilitate collaboration and support integration of
open source technologies. Learn more at [openinfra.org](https://openinfra.org).

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation and OpenInfra Foundation support
the event financially.
