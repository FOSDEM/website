The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is an open source
software foundation dedicated to making cloud native computing
universal and sustainable. Cloud native computing uses an open
source software stack to deploy applications as microservices,
packaging each part into its own container, and dynamically
orchestrating those containers to optimize resource utilization.
We host and nurture components of cloud native software
stacks, including Kubernetes, Envoy and Prometheus. 

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) supports the event financially.
