The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) is an open source
software foundation dedicated to making cloud native computing
universal and sustainable. Cloud native computing uses an open source
software stack to deploy applications as microservices, packaging each
part into its own container, and dynamically orchestrating those
containers to optimize resource utilization. We host and nurture
components of cloud native software stacks, including Kubernetes,
Envoy and Prometheus. Come and meet the CNCF team at stand 16 on level
2 of the K building.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) supports the event
financially.
