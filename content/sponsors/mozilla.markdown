[Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) is the non-profit backed technology company
that champions privacy, human dignity, and an open internet. Our mission is to
ensure the internet is a global public resource, open and accessible to all.

We have been pioneering stakeholder capitalism in tech for the past 25 years.
Our next quarter century will be about continuing to do more, from helping build
responsible tech products to growing the community, thanks to new talent that
truly cares about making the internet better.

The web should put people first — and be open to everyone, empowering and safe.
It should be a place that revels in the independent spirit, allows for
connection and community building, and to express yourself in your most
authentic way.

That’s why we created [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/) as a
faster, more private browser alternative.

Firefox offers a choice in the marketplace — a people-first independent
choice. It allows users to be their authentic self online while at the same
time supporting an independent, nonprofit-backed browser whose mission is to
build a better internet.

Mozilla supports the event financially.
