<p>They are the premier information source for leading-edge computer technologies and communicate the knowledge of experts through our books, conferences, and web sites. Their books, known for their animals on the covers, occupy a treasured place on the shelves of the developers building the next generation of software. Their conferences and summits bring innovators together to shape the revolutionary ideas that spark new industries. From the Internet to the web, Linux, Open Source, and now peer-to-peer networking, O'Reilly puts technologies on the map.</p>

<p>O'Reilly supports the event financially.</p>
