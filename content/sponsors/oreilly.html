<p>Once again, we are proud to have O’Reilly as one of our sponsors.</p>

<p>
  They are the premier information source for leading-edge computer technologies
  and communicate the knowledge of experts through books, conferences, and web
  sites.  Their books, sporting the iconic animals on the covers, occupy a
  treasured place on the shelves of the developers building the next generation
  of software.  Their conferences and summits bring innovators together to shape
  the revolutionary ideas that spark new industries.  From the Internet to the
  web, Linux, Open Source, and now peer-to-peer networking, O’Reilly puts
  technologies on the map.

<p>O’Reilly supports the event financially.</p>
