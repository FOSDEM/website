Bloomberg is building the world's most trusted information network for
financial professionals. Our 9,000+ engineers are advancing and building
new systems for the Bloomberg Terminal to solve complex, real-world
problems -- preferably relying on open source in our infrastructure and
solutions.

Over the last two decades, Bloomberg has undergone a journey and cultural
shift in becoming an 'open source first' company. Today, our engineers
are actively engaged in the open source ecosystem as users, participants,
contributors, and leaders. Hundreds of global employees, including senior
leadership, support our open source efforts, with Bloomberg's Open
Source Program Office (OSPO) spearheading our efforts to use, produce,
publish and support open source software.

We've also infused Bloomberg's unique culture of philanthropy into our
open source strategy, through a partnership with the company's Corporate
Philanthropy team for Bloomberg's FOSS Contributor Fund, our Open Source
Dollars For Your Hours program, and a successful skills-based volunteer
program.

Bloomberg supports the event financially.
