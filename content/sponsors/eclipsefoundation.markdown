Headquartered in Brussels, Belgium, the Eclipse Foundation is a global
non-profit supported by over 385 members. We host a diverse range of
open source projects, including the Eclipse IDE, Adoptium, Software
Defined Vehicle, Jakarta EE, and more than 420 other initiatives,
including runtimes, tools, specifications, and frameworks. Our
projects serve a broad range of applications and sectors like cloud
computing, edge and IoT, automotive, embedded systems, systems
engineering, and open processor designs.

The foundation's unique value proposition lies in providing a
vendor-neutral governance framework that fosters collaboration across
technology domains, enabling individuals and organisations to drive
community-led, code-first, and commercial ready open source
innovation.

The Eclipse Foundation supports the event financially.
