GitHub is the best way to build software together.  Whether it’s your company’s
app, your favorite open source library, or a weekend side project, GitHub helps
everyone work together better by providing tools for easier collaboration and
code sharing.  Catch up on what happened while you were out or ask for help on a
tricky chunk of code.  Manage and contribute to projects from all your devices.
The best part is you can keep using all of your favorite tools.  Start
collaborating on code today—open source project hosting is free!
