GitHub is how people build software. Millions of individuals and
organizations around the world use GitHub to discover, share, and
collaborate on software—from games and experiments to popular
frameworks and leading applications. Together, we’re defining how
software is built today.

Whether you use GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise on your own servers,
you can access one of the world’s largest developer communities to
build software in the way that works best for you. Choose your
deployment option and integrate your favorite third party tools into
a powerful, collaborative workflow.

GitHub supports the event financially.
