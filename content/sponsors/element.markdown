Element is an open source messaging and collaboration platform.

We give people and organisations back their digital sovereignty by
decentralising conversations, letting you host yourself or through a
hosting provider such as Element Matrix Services.

Element is built on [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) - an open network
for secure, decentralised communication - for easy connectivity with
any of the 44M addressable users on the public Matrix network.
Additional privacy is provided by end-to-end encryption, protecting
instant messaging, 1:1 voice and video calls, and file sharing.

Element was founded by the team behind Matrix as a way to bring it to
the mainstream.

Element provides the chat infrastructure.
