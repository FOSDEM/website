First released in 2008, OpenNebula has become the only European open
source technology for cloud-edge orchestration and management,
supporting both virtual machines and Kubernetes clusters. OpenNebula
Systems was born in 2010 in order to provide professional support to
corporate users and sustain the development of the project in the long
term. With more than 5,000 organizations running an OpenNebula cloud
worldwide, OpenNebula Systems helps organizations from many different
sectors to adopt a vendor-neutral, multi-provider approach for
building their private, public, and hybrid clouds.

OpenNebula Systems is headquartered in Madrid (Spain) but became a
full-remote company in 2021, hosting a growing, global team of open
source enthusiasts. Apart from being a corporate member of the Linux
Foundation, the CNCF, and Gaia-X, OpenNebula Systems plays a key role
in shaping Europe’s next-generation edge cloud, chairing the
Cloud/Edge Working Group of the “European Alliance for Industrial
Data, Edge and Cloud” while coordinating the actions and EU-funded
projects launched by the SovereignEdge.EU initiative. For more
