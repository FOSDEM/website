<p>
    We believe that the former dates of the stands cfp would
    create logistical problems.

    Therefore we are going to switch the dates as follow:

    <ul>
        <li>Submission deadline <b>10th November</b> instead of 20th of November</li>
        <li>Publication date on <b>20th November</b> instead of 4th December</li>
    </ul>

    We apologise for the confusion!
    If you arrive late for the submission, drop us a mail at stands@fosdem.org
</p>
