<p>
    FOSDEM 2024 will take place at the ULB on the 3th and 4th of February 2024.
    As has become traditional, we offer free and open source projects a stand to display their work “in real life” to the audience. You can share information, demo software, interact with your users and developers, give away goodies, sell merchandise or accept donations. All is possible!
