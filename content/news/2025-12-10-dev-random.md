The room formally known as "lightning talks" room is now known as `/dev/random`.

[Last year](https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6674-lightning-lightning-talks/)
we experimented with running a more spontaneous lightning talk format, with a
submission deadline closer to the event and strict short time limits (under
five minutes) for each speaker.

The experiment was a success, so we're going to continue using this format in
the upcoming FOSDEM edition and expand it slightly.

To avoid getting the existing lightning talk room mixed up with the new format
lightning talks, we have renamed it to `/dev/random`. The format is still the
same as in previous years, with 15 minute talks about various random but
interesting subjects.

If you have something interesting you want to talk about which didn't make it
into one of the other devrooms, trim it down to 15 minutes and submit here!

To propose a `/dev/random` talk, go to
<a href="https://fosdem.org/submit">https://fosdem.org/submit</a>
and select /dev/random as the track.

The deadline for `/dev/random` submissions is the **10th January**, with
accepted talks being notified around the 17th.

Keep an eye out for more details about taking part in lightning talks, but expect:

- Around 5 minute time limit
- Submissions opening closer to the event, and closing a day or two before
- Slides submitted as .pdf as part of the proposal
- Two sessions, one on each day
