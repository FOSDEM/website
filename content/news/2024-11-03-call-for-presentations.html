  FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to
  meet, share ideas and collaborate.  Renowned for being highly
  developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from
  all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  The twenty-fifth edition will take place on Saturday 1st and Sunday 2nd
  February 2025 at the usual location, ULB Campus Solbosch in Brussels.
</p>

<h3>Developer Rooms</h3>

<p>
  For more details about submission to Developer Rooms, please refer to each
  devroom's Call for Participation <a
href="page:news/2024-10-28-devrooms-announced">listed here</a>.
</p>

<h3>Main Tracks</h3>

<p>
  Main track presentations cover topics of interest to a
  significant part of our audience that do not fit into any of
  the developer rooms, perhaps because of the topic or the large size of the anticipated audience.
  Presentations should be 50 minutes long including audience questions.
  Where necessary, FOSDEM covers reasonable travel expenses agreed in advance
  and arranges accommodation for accepted main track speakers.

<h3>Lightning talks</h3>

<p>
  Lightning talks are short (15 minute) talks on a wide variety of topics.
  Anyone who has something interesting to say about a free software or open
  source project or topic can apply.  We particularly encourage topics that do
  not fit into any of the other tracks.
