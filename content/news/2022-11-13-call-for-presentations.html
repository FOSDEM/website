<p>
  FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to
  meet, share ideas and collaborate.  Renowned for being highly
  developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from
  all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  The twenty-third edition will take place on Saturday 4th and Sunday 5th
  February 2023 at the usual location, ULB Campus Solbosch in Brussels.
  It will also be possible to participate online.
</p>

<h3>Developer Rooms</h3>

<p>
  For more details about the Developer Rooms, please refer to the Calls for Papers that are being added to <a 
href="page:news/2022-11-07-accepted-developer-rooms">https://fosdem.org/2023/news/2022-11-07-accepted-developer-rooms/</a> when they are issued.
</p>

<h3>Main Tracks</h3>

<p>
  Main track presentations cover topics of interest to a
  significant part of our audience that do not fit into any of
  the developer rooms, perhaps because of the topic or the large size of the anticipated audience.
  Presentations should be 50 minutes long including audience questions.
  FOSDEM covers reasonable travel expenses agreed in advance
  and arranges accommodation for accepted main track speakers if needed.

</p>

<h3>Lightning talks</h3>

<p>
  Lightning talks are short, 15 minute, talks on a wide
  variety of topics.  Anyone who has something interesting to say about a
  free software or open source project or topic can apply.  We particularly
  encourage topics that do not fit into any of the other tracks.

<h3>Online Presentations</h3>

<p>
  In addition to the in-person presentations, some tracks will also accept
  pre-recorded online presentations.
  Please indicate on the submission form whether the presentation 
  could be offered on-campus and/or pre-recorded online.
</p>

<p>
  Speakers accepted for a virtual presentation will need to prepare,
  record and upload it in early January, no later than <b>Friday 20th January</b>.  
  Guidance will be provided.  Speakers will need to be in
  a place with a computer with a reliable internet connection and working camera
  and microphone when their presentation is scheduled so they can join a video
  room and take questions and engage in discussion after their
  pre-recorded presentation is played.
</p>
