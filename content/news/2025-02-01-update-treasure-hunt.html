title: 'FOSDEM Treasure Hunt Update – Signs Stolen, But the Hunt Continues!'
---
<p>
    Treasure hunters, we have an update!
    Unfortunately, some of our signs have been removed or stolen, but don’t worry—the hunt is still on!
</p>
---MORE---

<p>
    To ensure everyone can continue, we will be posting all signs online so you can still access the riddles and keep progressing. However, there is one exception: the 4th riddle must still be heard in person at Building H, as it includes an important radio message.
</p>
<p>
    Keep your eyes on our updates, stay determined, and don’t let a few missing signs stop you from cracking the code! Good luck, and see you at Infodesk K with the final answer!</p>
