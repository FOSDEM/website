<p>
  FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to
  meet, share ideas and collaborate.  Renowned for being highly
  developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from
  all over the world.
</p>

<p>
  The twenty-fourth edition will take place on Saturday 3rd and Sunday 4th
  February 2024 at the usual location, ULB Campus Solbosch in Brussels.
</p>

<h3>Developer Rooms</h3>

<p>
  For more details about the Developer Rooms, please refer to the Calls for Papers at <a 
href="page:news/2023-11-08-devrooms-announced">https://fosdem.org/2024/news/2023-11-08-devrooms-announced</a>.
</p>

<h3>Main Tracks</h3>

<p>
  Main track presentations cover topics of interest to a
  significant part of our audience that do not fit into any of
  the developer rooms, perhaps because of the topic or the large size of the anticipated audience.
  Presentations should be 50 minutes long including audience questions.
  Where necessary, FOSDEM covers reasonable travel expenses agreed in advance
  and arranges accommodation for accepted main track speakers.

<h3>Lightning talks</h3>

<p>
  Lightning talks are short talks on a wide variety of topics.  
  Traditionally at FOSDEM these have been 15 minutes long 
  but this year we also intend to accept some 5 minute talks.
  Anyone who has something interesting to say about a
  free software or open source project or topic can apply.  
  We particularly
  encourage topics that do not fit into any of the other tracks.
  When submitting this year, please set the Duration field to 
  either 5 minutes or 15 minutes. (If you request 15 minutes but
  would be willing to accept a 5 minute slot instead, mention this 
  in the Submission Notes field.)

<h3>Submission</h3>

<p>
  All proposals for presentations at the event should be submitted through
  pretalx: <a href="https://fosdem.org/submit">https://fosdem.org/submit</a>.
  When making a proposal, please select the appropriate track.
</p>

<p>
If the topic fits into a <b>Developer Room</b>, then
  please refer to that room's call for papers, listed
  <a
href="page:news/2023-11-08-devrooms-announced">here</a>.
  and select that room as the "track".
  Select <b>Lightning Talks</b> for the separate Lightning Talks track outside the developer rooms (but not for lightning talks inside devrooms).
</p>

<p>
  Submissions will be reviewed as they are received on an ongoing basis.
  The default deadline this year is <b>8th December</b> but some developer 
  rooms have specified a slightly different date which could be 
  a few days <b>earlier</b> or later so do check the Call for Papers for 
  your track carefully!
