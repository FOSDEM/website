title: 'Birds of a Feather rooms'
---

As in previous years, some small rooms will be available for 
Birds of a Feather sessions.

---MORE---

The concept is simple: Any project or community can reserve a timeslot
(30 minutes or 1 hour) during which they have the room just to themselves.

These rooms are intended for ad-hoc discussions, meet-ups or brainstorming
sessions. They are not a replacement for a developer room and they are
certainly not intended for talks. 

Schedules: [BOF Track A](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/bofa/), [BOF Track B](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/bofb/), [BOF Track C](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/bofc/).

To apply for a BOF session, enter your proposal at [https://fosdem.org/submit](https://fosdem.org/submit). Select any of the BOF tracks and mention in the Submission Notes your preferred timeslots and any times you are unavailable.

Reservations can be made in advance or during the event itself subject to capacity.
