<p>
   We are pleased to announce the developer rooms that will be organised at
   FOSDEM 2025.

---MORE---
<p>
   Developer rooms are assigned to self-organising groups to work together on
   open source projects, to discuss topics relevant to a broader subset of the
   community, etc. The individual developer room organisers will issue their
   calls for participation in the next few days. The list below will be updated
   accordingly.
