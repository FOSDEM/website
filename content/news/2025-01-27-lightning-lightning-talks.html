title: 'Introducing Lightning Lightning Talks'
---
<p>
The regular FOSDEM lightning talk track isn't chaotic enough, so this year
we're introducing Lightning Lightning Talks (now with added lightning!).

<p>Thought of a last minute topic you want to share? Got your interesting
talk rejected? Has something exciting happened in the last few weeks you want
to talk about?<p>

<p>Get that talk submitted to Lightning Lightning Talks!</p>

<p>This is an experimental session taking place on Sunday afternoon
(<a href="https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6674-lightning-lightning-talks/">13:00 in k1105</a>),
containing non-stop lightning fast 5 minute talks.</p>

<p>Submitted talks will be automatically presented by our Lightning Lightning
Talk System, which keeps track of the time limit for the current speaker and
the order of presentations.</p>

<p>Presenters who attempt to speak for longer than 5 minutes risk being swept
off the stage by our Lightning Lightning Talk Cleanup Crew.</p>

<h2>Why?</h2>

<p>The FOSDEM lightning talk track contains lightning talks, but they are 15
minutes long and scheduled months in advance. This Lightning Lightning Talk
session tries to bring more lightning to FOSDEM, with a faster pace and more
spontaneous talks.</p>

<p>If this format works well, we might expand this in future editions (feedback
welcome!).</p>
