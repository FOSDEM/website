title: 'Birds of a Feather/Unconference rooms'
---
As in previous years, some small rooms will be available for Unconference style "Birds of a Feather sessions".

---MORE---

The concept is simple: Any project or community can reserve a timeslot (1 hour) during which they have the room just to themselves.

These rooms are intended for ad-hoc discussions, meet-ups or brainstorming sessions. They are not a replacement for a developer room and they are certainly not intended for talks.

To apply for a BOF session, enter your proposal at https://fosdem.org/submit. Select the BOF/Unconference track and mention in the Submission Notes your preferred timeslots and any times you are unavailable. Also mention if you expect a large audience (most rooms are 40, one has 80 persons).

Reservations can be made in advance or during the event itself subject to capacity.
