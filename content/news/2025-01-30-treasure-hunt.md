title: 'Join the FOSDEM Treasure Hunt!'

Are you ready for a challenge? We're hosting a treasure hunt at FOSDEM, where participants must solve six
sequential riddles to uncover the final answer. Teamwork is allowed and encouraged, so gather your friends and
put your problem-solving skills to the test!

The six riddles are set up across different locations on campus. Your task is to find the correct locations,
solve the riddles, and progress to the next step. No additional instructions will be given after this
announcement, it's up to you to navigate and decipher the clues!

To keep things fair, no hints or tips will be given until the end of the first day, so participants will have
to rely on their own ingenuity to progress.

The first two individuals or teams to arrive at Infodesk K with the correct answer will win a special FOSDEM
prize! The prize is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, and the answer must be validated by the staff
member responsible for the treasure hunt before confirming a winner.

If the responsible staff member is not at Infodesk K when you arrive with your answer, please wait and ask a
FOSDEM staff member to contact them.

Good luck, and may the best problem-solvers win!
