---MORE---
<p>
FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Renowned for being highly developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from all over the world.
</p>
<p>
The twenty-fourth edition will take place <b>Saturday 3th and Sunday 4th February 2024</b> in <b>Brussels, Belgium</b>.
</p>
<p>
Developer rooms are assigned to self-organising groups to work together on open source and free software projects, to discuss topics relevant to a broader subset of the community, etc. Most content should take the form of presentations. Proposals involving collaboration across project or domain boundaries are strongly encouraged.
</p>
<p>
This edition will take place in person only, we will not offer the option for virtual/hybrid devrooms with remote presentations. We wil however still stream and record sessions, with a live chat for remote participants.
</p>
<p>
Devroom managers must enter a complete schedule into our conference system by 15th December. 
</p>
<p>
Developer room proposals should be submitted through the form at <a href="https://fosdem.org/devroom">https://fosdem.org/devroom</a> which contains further information.</p>
