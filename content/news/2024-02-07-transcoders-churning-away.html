title: Video transcoders churning away
---

<p>FOSDEM is over, but our video infrastructure is still working hard!</p>

---MORE---

<p>This year, there were 855 events in rooms where the FOSDEM video team
had equipment to stream, record, and publish everything, for a total of
365 scheduled hours of content. Postprocessing that much video is a
massive task that takes quite a bit of effort; for this reason, since
the 2017 edition, we have crowdsourced most of the manual work that
needs to happen for this postprocessing to the devroom organizers and
the speakers, as explained in <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2019/schedule/event/media_sreview/">this
talk at FOSDEM 2019</a>.</p>

<p>As of this writing, out of those 855 talks, 544 have been reviewed by
their speakers and/or devroom organizers and are either available to be
wachted through <a href="https://video.fosdem.org/2024/">our video
	archive</a> or <a href="/2024/schedule">the schedule</a>. If you
want to know what happened with your favourite talk, please see
<a href="https://review.video.fosdem.org/overview">our review
	overview page</a>.</p>

<p>Currently, however, our encoders are starting to run dry, and we need
more work for them. If you were a speaker or devroom organizer at
FOSDEM, please check your mailbox and review the video of your talk(s)
as soon as possible, so that we can release them to the world. To do
this, you should have received an email with instructions on the email
address you entered into pretalx, our conference management application.
If you did not receive such an email, please contact us so we can help
you get that resolved.</p>
