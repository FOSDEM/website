<p>
Are you ready for another challenge? We're excited to host the second yearly edition of our treasure hunt at FOSDEM! Participants must solve five sequential challenges to uncover the final answer.

<p>
Teamwork is allowed and encouraged! So gather your friends and put your problem-solving skills to the test. 
Your task is to work through each challenge in order, solving the riddles to progress to the next step. No additional instructions will be given after this announcement; it’s up to you to navigate and decipher the clues on your own.
To keep things fair, no hints or tips will be provided until the end of the first day, so participants will need to rely entirely on their ingenuity to move forward.
</p>

<p>
The first two individuals or teams to arrive at Infodesk K with the correct final answer will win a special FOSDEM prize! Prizes are awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, and all answers must be validated by the staff member responsible for the treasure hunt before a winner is confirmed.
</p>

<p>
If the responsible staff member is not present at Infodesk K when you arrive, please wait and ask a FOSDEM staff member to contact them.
</p>

<p>
You can find the challenges near Infodesk K and H. or in this newspost. Good luck!
