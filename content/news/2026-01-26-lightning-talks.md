The same as [last year](https://archive.fosdem.org/2025/schedule/event/fosdem-2025-6674-lightning-lightning-talks/): come and take part in a very rapid set of talks!

---MORE---

Thought of a last minute topic you want to share? Got your interesting
talk rejected? Has something exciting happened in the last few weeks you want
to talk about?

Get that talk submitted to Lightning Lightning Talks!

We have two sessions for participants to speak about subjects which are
interesting, amusing, or just something the FOSDEM audience would appreciate:

- [Saturday](/2026/schedule/event/CNPVJL-lightning_lightning_talks_1/)
- [Sunday](/2026/schedule/event/G3ZWYU-lightning_lightning_talks_2/)

Selected speakers line up and present in one continuous automated stream, with
an SLO of 99% talk uptime.

To submit your talk for this session, make sure you meet some standards:

- will be presented in less than or equal to 256 seconds (very strict time limit!)
- slides created in .pdf format
- nothing too offensive
- about something FOSDEM attendees would appreciate

Reviews will be done on a rolling basis until the evening before each session
(so friday evening for the saturday session, saturday evening for the sunday
session). There will be some priority given to entertaining and lighthearted
talks (until we have too many and need something serious to balance them out).

To submit a talk, follow these steps:

1. Follow [this link](https://fosdem.org/submit) and press the "Submit a proposal" button
1. Select track "Lightning Talks"
1. Attach your slides in pdf format as a resource
1. Wait for an acceptance notification, which will be sent out periodically as we get closer to the event
1. Confirm you'll be able to attend the session
1. Await further instructions
