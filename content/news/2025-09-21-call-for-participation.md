title: 'FOSDEM 2026 Call for Participation'
---

Proposals for **developer rooms** and **main track talks** for FOSDEM 2026 can
now be submitted!

---MORE---

FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to meet, share
ideas and collaborate.  Renowned for being highly developer-oriented, the event
brings together some 8000+ geeks from all over the world.

The twenty-sixth edition will take place on Saturday 31st January and Sunday
1st February 2026 at the usual location, ULB Campus Solbosch in Brussels.

## Developer Rooms

Developer rooms are assigned to self-organising groups to work together on open
source and free software projects, to discuss topics relevant to a broader
subset of the community, etc. Most content should take the form of
presentations. Proposals involving collaboration across project or domain
boundaries are strongly encouraged.

As usual, we unfortunately have a very hard limit on the number of devrooms we
accept due to the realities of the physical space available to us. Every year
we must make difficult decisions about which great proposals must be rejected
(in the past we could have filled the entire conference with every devroom
about a different programming language!). If you submitted a proposal for a
devroom in the last few years and got rejected, don't be disheartened and
submit anyway!

This year we are slightly changing the way we make the choices of which
devrooms we select. We want to focus a little more on promoting collaboration
and community between different projects in niches which don't normally have
their own spaces, rather than large projects with significant corporate
backing.

As an example, we want some more weird and wonderful Plan9 ecosystem devrooms.

If you have questions or need help crafting a good submission, contact us at
<a href="mailto:program@fosdem.org">program@fosdem.org</a>.

The deadline for submissions is **12th October**.

Key dates:

- **12 October**: deadline for developer room proposals
- **26 October**: accepted developer rooms announced
- **30 October (or earlier)**: developer rooms issue Calls for Participation
- **15 December (or earlier)**: developer rooms publish complete schedules

## Main Track Talks

Main track presentations cover topics of interest to a significant part of our
audience that do not fit into any of the usual developer rooms, perhaps because
of the topic or the large size of the anticipated audience.

This year presentations are either 25 or 50 minutes long including audience
questions.

Submission for talks in devrooms will open after devrooms are selected and
announced.

The conference language is English. All content must relate to Free and Open
Source Software. By participating in the event you agree to the publication of
recordings, slides and other content provided under the same licence as all
FOSDEM content (CC-BY).  You also accept the
<a href="page:practical/conduct">FOSDEM Code of Conduct</a>.

The deadline for submissions is **16th November**.
