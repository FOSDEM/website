---MORE---

FOSDEM 2026 will take place at the ULB on the 31st of January and 1st of February 2026.

As has become traditional, we offer free and open source projects a stand to display their
work to the audience. You can share information, demo software, interact with your users 
and developers, give away goodies, sell merchandise or accept donations. All is possible!

We offer you:

- One table (180x80cm) with a set of chairs and a power socket
- Fast wireless internet access

You can choose if you want the spot for the entire conference, or simply for one day. 
Joint submissions (sharing a table) will be favoured in the process.

After sending your proposal you may add all relevant people, that should be informed, to it.

- Submit your application at <a href="https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026-call-for-stands">https://fosdem.org/stands</a>
- Deadline closes the **9th of November**;
- Accepted stands will be announced the **16th of November**.
