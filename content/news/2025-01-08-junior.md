FOSDEM Junior is a collaboration between FOSDEM, Code Club, CoderDojo, developers, and volunteers to organize workshops and activities for children during the FOSDEM weekend.

These activities are for children to learn and get inspired about technology. This year's activities include microcontrollers, embroidery, game development, music, and mobile application development. 

Last year we organized the first edition of FOSDEM Junior. We are pleased to announce that we will be back this year.

Registration for individual workshops is required. Links can be found on the page of each activity. The full schedule can be viewed at the [junior track schedule page](https://fosdem.org/2025/schedule/track/junior/).

You can contact the organisers by using the dedicated email address: junior@fosdem.org. There is a mailing list for public discussions about FOSDEM Junior, which can be subscribed to via [junior-discuss](https://lists.fosdem.org/listinfo/junior-discuss).
