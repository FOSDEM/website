FOSDEM offers open source and free software developers a place to meet, share ideas and collaborate. Renowned for being highly developer-oriented, the event brings together some 8000+ geeks from all over the world.
</p>
<p>
The twenty-fifth edition will take place <b>Saturday 1st and Sunday 2nd February 2025</b> in <b>Brussels, Belgium</b>.
</p>
<p>
Developer rooms are assigned to self-organising groups to work together on open source and free software projects, to discuss topics relevant to a broader subset of the community, etc. Most content should take the form of presentations. Proposals involving collaboration across project or domain boundaries are strongly encouraged.
