  Every year, an enthusiastic band of volunteers make FOSDEM happen and make it a fun and safe place for all our attendees. We could not do this without you. This year we again need as many hands as possible, especially for heralding during the conference, during the buildup (starting Friday at noon) and teardown (Sunday evening). No need to worry about missing lunch at the weekend, food will be provided. 
</p>

<p>
  Would you like to be part of the team that makes FOSDEM tick? <a href="https://volunteers.fosdem.org">Sign up here!</a> You could really help us out with the following: 
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Build-up - Setting up the venue on Friday: this mostly involves carrying tables to their destinations and setting them up, putting up signage, covering the walls in brown paper... in short: transform the campus into a conference venue. We need as many volunteers as possible for this task.</li>
    <li>Network - Deploying the network on Friday: rolling out, neatly securing and crimping UTP cables. People with experience rolling out networks and crimping cables are very welcome!</li>
    <li>InfoDesk - Be available at the InfoDesk during the weekend: help out fellow attendees with their questions, sell t-shirts etc. Proficiency in English is a must, but if you are proficient in other languages as well, it certainly wouldn't hurt.</li>
    <li>VirtuaL InfoDesk - Want to volunteer, but cant be present at the ULB? We also have our InfoDesk on Matrix. Provide technical support for people watching streams, or pic up other questions about FOSDEM as them come in.</li>
    <li>Heralding - Briefly introduce the speakers and the topics of their talks, make sure all talks end on time by giving speakers cues near the end of their time slot. Keep an eye out on room safety and report potential issues such as overcrowded rooms before it becomes more than a "potential" issue. </li>
    <li>Video - Capturing and recording video. Ensure the livestreams to thousands are up and running and all talks are recorded. </li>
    <li>Tear-down - (and cleanup) on Sunday evening: collecting beer bottles, tearing down the network, pulling brown paper off the walls, taking down the signage, stacking the rental tables in neat heaps, broom the floors etc. Basically, make sure we're welcome again next year. </li>
    <li>Upacking the van on Monday - All of our gear needs to come out of the vans and back into storage after the conference. </li>
    <li>And many the many other tasks and ways to volunteer over the weekend. </li>
</ul>
