## Before FOSDEM

### Slides: technical requirements
Please create slides with a 16/9 aspect ratio. 1920x1080 (recommended) or 1280x720 (acceptable) will do.

You may want to keep a copy with 4/3 aspect ratio handy for best results should the room projector in your room have a native 4/3 resolution. 1280x960 will also do.

### Matrix account
As a speaker, you might want a Matrix account.  You should already have been invited by email (or Matrix, if we know your Matrix ID) to sign up to Matrix and join the relevant chatrooms.  If not, you can get a Matrix account at https://chat.fosdem.org.  Then, to receive the invites, please enter your Matrix ID (e.g. @matthew:fosdem.org) under your account details on [https://pretalx.fosdem.org](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2025/me/) (look for the 'Matrix-id' field) and you'll be invited shortly. We send out invites a few times a day.

You should be invited to:

 * [#speakers:fosdem.org](https://matrix.to/#/#speakers:fosdem.org) (the main coordination point for speakers)
 * The backstage room for your devroom, where you can coordinate with the devroom organisers and your hosts
 * The devroom itself.

### Uploading slides

 * You can upload your slides and additional resources such as links to your repo on [pretalx](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2025/me/submissions/). Look for the resources section.
