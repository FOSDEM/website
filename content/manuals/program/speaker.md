## Before FOSDEM

### Slides: technical requirements

For your presentation slides, use a 16:9 aspect ratio with a recommended resolution of 1920×1080. If needed, 1280×720 is also acceptable. While 16:9 is a good default, it is a good idea to keep a 4:3 version (e.g., 1280×960) on hand as a backup.

When designing your slides, pay attention to your colour scheme. Opt for high-contrast colours to ensure readability in both very dark and very bright rooms. Additionally, as you may be presenting in a large room, confirm that all text and visuals remain clear and easy to read, regardless of the audience’s distance from the screen.

### Matrix account
As a speaker, you might want a Matrix account.  You should already have been invited by email (or Matrix, if we know your Matrix ID) to sign up to Matrix and join the relevant chatrooms.  If not, you can get a Matrix account at https://chat.fosdem.org.  Then, to receive the invites, please enter your Matrix ID (e.g. @matthew:fosdem.org) under your account details on [https://pretalx.fosdem.org](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026/me/) (look for the 'Matrix-id' field) and you'll be invited shortly. We send out invites a few times a day.

You should be invited to:
 * [#speakers:fosdem.org](https://matrix.to/#/#speakers:fosdem.org?web-instance[element.io]=chat.fosdem.org) (the main coordination point for speakers)
 * The backstage room for your devroom, where you can coordinate with the devroom organisers and your hosts
 * The devroom itself.

### Uploading slides

 * You can upload your slides and additional resources such as links to your repo on [pretalx](https://pretalx.fosdem.org/fosdem-2026/me/submissions/). Look for the resources section. 

## During FOSDEM

### Slides capture

The slides capture system will accept hdmi input. Please bring your own whatever-to-hdmi adapter should you need any. Adapters for mini-dp, usb-c and possibly more will be provided on a best effort basis.

Please mind the following requirements:

- 60 Hz or lower video output refresh rate
- 1080p (1920x1080) or lower output resolution

Please do not touch the video capture boxes except for providing them with hdmi input. We'll love to show you around the video boxes, but rather not in live production.

### Talk Q&A: live audience interaction and text based questions from chat.fosdem.org
