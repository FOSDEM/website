    <p>
      FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised by the community for
      the community.  The goal is to provide free and open source software developers
      and communities a place to meet to:

        </li>
        <li>
          be informed about the latest developments in the free software world;
        </li>
        <li>
          be informed about the latest developments in the open source world;
        </li>

          project leaders and committers;
        </li>
        <li>
          to promote the development and benefits of free software and open source
          solutions.
        </li>

    <h2 id="history">A bit of history</h2>
    <p>
      FOSDEM began in 2000 when Raphael Bauduin, a supporter of the Linux
      movement in Belgium, organised a small gathering for Open Source
      developers called the "Open Source Developers’ European Meeting" (OSDEM).
      A mailing list, a simple website, and word of mouth quickly attracted
      interest, and several prominent figures in the Open Source community,
      including Carsten Haitzler (Rasterman), Gordon Lyon (Fyodor), and Jeremy
      Allison, joined the inaugural event. The enthusiasm for the meeting set
      the stage for its future growth.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following year, OSDEM was renamed FOSDEM (Free and Open Source
      Software Developers’ European Meeting). Since then, FOSDEM has evolved
      into one of the largest gatherings of Free and Open Source enthusiasts in
      the world. Today, it hosts over 8000 developers annually at the ULB
      Solbosch campus in Brussels, offering a platform for collaboration across
      hundreds of projects and diverse technical tracks.
    </p>

    <p>
      Over the years, FOSDEM has adapted to changing community needs:
      introducing new tracks and adding more developer rooms, reaching out to
      younger generations, offering more space to emerging technologies and
      fostering collaboration across communities. FOSDEM also aims to stream and
      record all events, to ensure accessibility for contributors around the
      globe.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since its inception now more than 25 years ago, the event has grown into a
      community-driven initiative, coordinated by a dedicated team, solely
      consisting of volunteers, that continues to carry the FOSDEM mission
      forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      The team has drafted and signed into effect a charter, which outlines the
      core values and rules by which the organisation operates, and has been
      published in full <a href="page:about/charter">here</a>.
