      <h2>What is FOSDEM?<a name="what">&nbsp;</a></h2>
      <p>
        FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised by the community for
        the community.  The goal is to provide free and open source software developers
        and communities a place to meet to:

        <ul class="info-list">

            get in touch with other developers and projects;
          </li>
          <li>
            be informed about the latest developments in the free software world;
          </li>
          <li>
            be informed about the latest developments in the open source world;
          </li>
          <li>
            attend interesting talks and presentations on various topics by
            project leaders and committers;
          </li>
          <li>
            to promote the development and benefits of free software and open source
            solutions.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>

    <h2>Developer rooms</h2>
    <p>
      The FOSDEM team feels it is very important for free and open source software
      developers around the world to be able to meet in “real life”.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this end, we have set up developer rooms (devrooms) with
      network/internet connectivity and projectors where teams can meet and
      showcase their projects.  Devrooms are a place for teams to discuss, hack
      and publicly present latest directions, lightning talks, news and
      discussions.
      We believe developers can benefit a lot from these meetings.

    <h2>A bit of history</h2>
    <p>
      In 2000, Raphael Bauduin, a fan of the Linux movement in Belgium, decided
      to organise a small meeting for developers of Open Source software. He
      called it 'Open Source Developers’ European Meeting' (OSDEM).
    </p>

    <p>
      Raphael created a mailing list, a small website and spread the word to
      people around him. Only a few weeks later, lots of people were waiting for
      an exciting event in Brussels! Invitations were sent to well-known
      figures in the community: Rasterman, Fyodor, Jeremy Allison and so on.
      They all gave a very positive response, and OSDEM was on the road to
      success.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the second year, OSDEM was renamed FOSDEM. And now, many years later,
      it has grown into the event it is today.
      We now try to cover a wide spectrum of free and open source software projects, and offer a
      platform for people to collaborate.  Every
      year, we host more than 5000 developers at the ULB Solbosch campus.
    </p>

    <p>
      Raphael is no longer the driving force behind FOSDEM. After 7 years of
      hard work he left the team for new Open Source plans. The FOSDEM flag
      is now proudly carried by the following people:
