        <h4>Visiting and videos</h4>
        <h5><span class="label label-info">Q:</span> In what timezone are you?</h5>
        <p>
            The conference is in Brussels time, which is CET (UTC + 1).

        <h5><span class="label label-info">Q:</span> I need a formal invitation for a VISA request</h5>
        <p>
            For legal reasons, the FOSDEM organization can only issue such letters of invitation to “main track” speakers for whom we also make
travel and hotel arrangements.
        </p>

        <p>If you are attending FOSDEM as part of your involvement with a project represented at our conference, we recommend you get in touch with
someone you know locally who is involved in the project and ask them to invite you.
        </p>

        <p>For information regarding Belgian visa requirements, we refer you to Belgium’s Foreign Affairs, Foreign Trade and Development Cooperation
website.
