        <h4><span class="label label-info">Q:</span> I need a formal invitation for a VISA request</h4>
        <p>
            For legal reasons, the FOSDEM organization can only issue such letters of invitation to “main track” speakers for whom we also make
travel and hotel arrangements.

        <p>If you are attending FOSDEM as part of your involvement with a project represented at our conference, we recommend you get in touch with
someone you know locally who is involved in the project and ask them to invite you.
