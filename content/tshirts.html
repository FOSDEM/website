        <h4>T-shirts and hoodies</h4>
        <p>
            We have T-shirts and hoodies again! As each year, they are a special limited edition to show our gratitude for
            you donating to FOSDEM. However, we are having a virtual conference this time, so the T-shirt process is a
            bit different from last year. For example, you don't have to queue and they won't run out this year.
        </p>
        <h5>T-shirts</h5>

            The t-shirt design this year is grey with the FOSDEM 2021 logo. They're yours in exchange for a donation of
            €25.

        <h5>Getting them</h5>
        <p>
            For the online edition, we partnered with an print-on-demand provider, which means that they won't run out at Saturday noon,
            as they normally do.
         </p>
         <p>

         <p>
             The delivery fee depends on the country you wish to ship to. There are several tiers depending on what country you select.
             Unfortunately you can't see them before you select a country.
