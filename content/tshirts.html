            We have T-shirts and hoodies again! As each year, they are a special limited edition to show our gratitude for
            you donating to FOSDEM. However, we are having a virtual conference this time, so the T-shirt process is a
            bit different from normal. For example, you don't have to queue and they won't run out this year.
        </p>
        <p>If you order by Sunday 16th January we will try to ship your order before the event so there is a chance it will arrive in time for you to wear it on camera!
        <p>
            You can get them till the end of the weekend after FOSDEM 2022 (2022-02-13). Don't miss out!
        </p>
