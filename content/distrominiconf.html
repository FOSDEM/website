<p>At <%= conference[:title] %>, the Distribution Miniconf will be at its fourth iteration.</p>

<p>At FOSDEM we care strongly about open source projects small and large.
FOSDEM was created as a meeting place where developers from different projects
and with different backgrounds can come together and share ideas, discuss, etc.</p>

<p>The devrooms have always been premier place for this. However, in recent
years we have reached the limit of our capacity, with more than double
proposals over rooms available. Distributions have always had a strong presence
at FOSDEM, however, we were faced with having to choose some distributions over
others.</p>

<p>Holding the distro miniconf provides a way to better achieve our goals in two ways:</p>
<ul>
    <li>by organizing a mini conference where all distributions can participate in, we foster collaboration and cross pollination,</li>
    <li>additionally, some rooms become available for use by other projects, thereby diversifying the audience and topics at FOSDEM.</li>
</ul>

<p>The idea of the distro miniconf is that rather than having several
distributions with their own respective and individual Developer Room, we will
host mixed conference rooms where talks and sessions will be organized <b>by
topic</b>, with contributors from all distributions attending and
participating.</p>

<p>In more detail:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Two (of the largest) devrooms will be allocated for the distro miniconf on both Saturday and Sunday,</li>
    <li>sessions will be scheduled by topic (see below)</li>
    <li>every project is welcome to join in <tt>:)</tt></li>
</ul>

<p>Topics are open for suggestions: whatever you think is appropriate as a
topic that is a recurring issue for distributions (governance, feature
tracking, trust mechanisms, ambassadors, ...); or something where you would
like to present your solutions for specific tasks to other distributions (e.g.
package building, translations, bug tracking, community infrastructure, ...).
Especially if you're interested in feedback, ideas and collaboration from and
with other projects... we'd love to hear about it <tt>:)</tt>.</p>

<p>The list of sessions that were held last year is <a href="https://archive.fosdem.org/2012/schedule/track/crossdistribution_devroom.html">available from the archives of 2012</a>.</p>

<p>If you're interested in participating, <a
href="http://lists.fosdem.org/mailman/listinfo/distributions">subscribe
directly to the mailing-list we've created for that purpose</a>. We will
discuss details, ideas, as well as the schedule there.</p>
