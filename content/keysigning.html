title: Keysigning
---
<p>
  The annual keysigning event at FOSDEM is one of the largest of its kind.
  With more than one hundred participants every year, it is an excellent
  opportunity to strengthen the web of trust.
</p>

<p>
  If you intend to participate in the PGP keysigning event at
  <%= conference()[:title] %>, you must submit the keys you would like to have
  signed to the keyserver listening on <code>ksp.fosdem.org</code>.  If you
  are using GnuPG, this can easily be accomplished with:
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
  <code>% gpg --keyserver ksp.fosdem.org --send-key [keyid]</code>
</p>

<p>
  You may want to verify that your submission made it to the keyserver by
  checking the list of submitted keys at <a
  href="http://ksp.fosdem.org/">http://ksp.fosdem.org/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  The deadline for submissions is <strong>Monday 31 January 2013</strong>.
  After this date, the keyserver will no longer accept submissions and the
  official keylist will be published.  Further instructions on what to do with
  the keylist and how to participate in the keysigning party itself will be
  communicated at that time.
</p>

<h3>Submission / Web of Trust Graphs</h3>
<p>
  During the submission period, graphs will be generated of the density of the
  web of trust and the rate at which keys are being submitted.  You can find
  these graphs at: <a
  href="https://ksp.fosdem.org/graphs/">https://ksp.fosdem.org/graphs/</a>
