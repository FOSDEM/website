  The annual keysigning event at FOSDEM is one of the largest of its kind.
  With more than one hundred participants every year, it is an excellent
  opportunity to strengthen the web of trust.  We use a slightly modified
  version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zimmermann%E2%80%93Sassaman_key-signing_protocol">
    Zimmermann-Sassaman key-signing protocol</a> relying on a key submission
  server rather than email to collect keys.

    Further information will be published in due course.

<% else %>

<h3>Before the event</h3>
<h4>Submit your keys</h4>
<p>
  <% if conf.fetch(:submission_closed) %>
  <span class="label label-info">
    The submission deadline has passed.
  </span>
  <% end %>
</p>

<p>
  If you intend to participate in the PGP keysigning event at
  <%= conference()[:title] %>, you must submit the keys you would like to have
  signed to the keyserver listening on <code>ksp.fosdem.org</code>.  If you
  are using GnuPG, this can easily be accomplished with:
</p>

<pre class="sh">
gpg --keyserver ksp.fosdem.org --send-key [keyid]
</pre>

<p>
  You may want to verify that your submission made it to the keyserver by
  checking the list of submitted keys at <a
  href="https://ksp.fosdem.org/">https://ksp.fosdem.org/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  During the submission period, graphs will be generated of the density of the
  web of trust and the rate at which keys are being submitted.  You can find
  these graphs at: <a
  href="https://ksp.fosdem.org/graphs/">https://ksp.fosdem.org/graphs/</a>
</p>

<p>
  The deadline for submissions is <strong><%= conf.fetch(:submission_deadline).strftime(dateformat) %></strong>.
  After this date, the keyserver will no longer accept submissions and the
  official keylist will be published.
</p>

<h4>Download the list of participants</h4>
<% unless conf.fetch(:list_published) %>
<p>
  <span class="label label-info">
    The list of participants has not yet been published!
  </span>
</p>
<% end %>

<p>
  If you are participating in the keysigning event (i.e.: you have submitted
  your key to the keyserver), you should download the final list of
  participants and follow its instructions closely.
</p>

<p>
<% if conf.fetch(:list_published) %>
  The final list of participants is available from
<% else %>
  The final list of participants will be available from
<% end %>
  <a href="https://ksp.fosdem.org/files/">https://ksp.fosdem.org/files/</a>.
</p>

<p>
  If there is a trust-path between you and the author, you should verify the
  list's detached signature using:
</p>
<pre class="sh">
gpg --verify ksp-<%= klist %>.txt.asc ksp-<%= klist %>.txt
</pre>

<p>
  The keysigning event takes place on Sunday, at 14:00, in the corridor on the
  second level of the U building.
  Please bring the printed list, a pen and appropriate form of identification
  with you to FOSDEM.
  Be on time!
</p>

<h3>After the event</h3>
<% unless conf.fetch(:hashes_published) %>
<p>
  <span class="label label-info">
    The hashes of the keylist have not been published yet.
  </span>
</p>
<% end %>

<p>
  If you participated in the keysigning event, but missed (parts of) the
  participant list hashes as they flashed by during the starting presentation,
  you should verify the hashes before signing any keys.
</p>

<p>
<% if conf.fetch(:hashes_published) %>
  The hashes can be downloaded from
<% else %>
  You will be able to download the hashes from
<% end %>
  <a href="https://ksp.fosdem.org/files/">https://ksp.fosdem.org/files/</a>.
  If there is a trust-path between you and the author, you should verify the
  file's detached signature using:
</p>
<pre class="sh">
gpg --verify ksp-<%= klist %>-hashes.txt.asc ksp-<%= klist %>-hashes.txt
</pre>

<p>
  Please complete your signing homework before
  <strong><%= conf.fetch(:homework_due).strftime(dateformat) %></strong>, and
  upload new signatures on your keys to a well-connected keyserver.  New
  statistics of the density of the web of trust at FOSDEM will be published
  soon after that date.
