<h3>Novel Coronavirus information (aka 2019-nCoV, Wuhan coronavirus)</h3>
<p>
  At the beginning of 2020 the World Health Organisation identified a new
  virus spreading in the city of Wuhan, Hubei province of China.
</p>
<p>
  As of Wed 29 Jan 2020, World Health Organisation and Belgian Government advice
  do not indicate a threat serious enough to require any changes to FOSDEM.
</p>
<p>
  We recommend that visitors who are concerned refer to
  <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/travel-advice">
    the World Health Organisation's travel advice
  </a>
  .
</p>
<p>
  <strong>If you are feeling unwell, please consider staying home or in your
  hotel.</strong> We know it's frustrating but it is best to avoid spreading
  illness, regardless of whether it's a cold, 2019-nCoV, or a more usual virus.
  You can <a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/streaming/">watch video
  live streams from all rooms</a> and use the #fosdem hashtag to participate in
  conversation on social media.
