<a name="security"></a><h2>Physical security</h2>
<p>The goal of FOSDEM is to organise an event where everyone can feel safe and
comfortable. For that purpose, we have invested in having multiple professional
security guards during the weekend.</p>

<p>If you see a (potential) problem, please approach one of them or a staff
member who can be recognised by his/her bright yellow t-shirt with "Staff" on
the back.</p>

<p>Some guidelines:</p>
<ul>
    <li>If you come by car, don't leave any valuables in it.</li>
    <li>Do not enter a room if the sign says it is full: We need to consider fire safety.</li>
    <li>Follow instructions given by the security guards or by a staff member: They are meant for your safety and that of others.</li>
</ul>
