<h3>FOSDEM 2021 is the first fully online edition of FOSDEM!</h3>
<p>
    Welcome to our first online edition. We still have our familiar programme of keynotes, devrooms and stands, but in a slightly different
    form. As we can't simply point you to the right room (always a challenge at the ULB), we've provided a lot more extra practical information
    so you can enjoy the conference.

<h3>Visiting the conference</h3>
<p>
    Visiting the conference is as always free. All talks (keynotes, devrooms) are on the <a href="page:schedule">schedule</a>, while the stands have
    their own <a href="https://stands.fosdem.org">website</a>. To make this a real conference instead of a stream of videos, we've combined our
    existing video system with <a href="https://jitsi.org/">Jitsi</a> for live video and <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a> for interaction and
    putting everything together.
</p>
<p>
    <b>You do not need an account to visit the conference, watch talks or visit stands.</b> You will need a Matrix account from 
    <a href="https://chat.fosdem.org"><i>chat.fosdem.org</i></a> (or elsewhere) to participate in the discussion or upvote questions. We'll explain all this, so don't
    worry!
</p>

<a name="talks"></a>
<h4>Talks</h4>
<p>
    The <a href="page:schedule">schedule</a> contains a link to each individual talk or devroom. Each devroom maps to a room on <a href="https://chat.fosdem.org"><i>chat.fosdem.org</i></a>. The
    keynotes are in the <i>keynote</i> room.
</p>
<img src="/2021/practical/screen_1.png" alt="Click on the marked button to start the video." aria-labelledby="virtual-room-view-before-you-can-start" style="max-width: 96%; margin: 2em 2% 0 2%;"/>
<div id="virtual-room-view-before-you-can-start" style="margin: .5em 2% 2em 2%; width: 96%;"><i>Before you can see any video, you will have to click the button (1.) to enable the video stream.</i></div>
<p>
    In each room, you'll see a fairly large widget which will display the video stream. The first time you visit <a href="https://chat.fosdem.org"><i>chat.fosdem.org</i></a>,
    you'll have to click <i>allow</i> so the widget can start playing videos. You can resize the video widget or watch it full screen.
</p>
<img src="/2021/practical/main_conference_screen.png" alt="Room view." aria-labelledby="virtual-room-view" style="max-width: 96%; margin: 2em 2% 0 2%;"/>
<div id="virtual-room-view" style="margin: .5em 2% 2em 2%; width: 96%;"><i>Room view. 1 is the video window; 2 is the chat window.</i></div>
<p>
    Below the video stream is the interactive part of FOSDEM 2021: the (Matrix) chat window. During the talk, you can discuss the topic with all other
    attendees. You will have to create a <a href="#chatting">Matrix account</a> to participate, and while we encourage free and open exchange of views,
    both the devroom and FOSDEM staff will be moderating the discussion. Any violations of our <a href="page:practical/conduct">code of conduct</a> will
    be acted on.
</p>
<p>
    If you find a question or remark interesting or useful, you can <a href="#upvoting">upvote it</a> by giving it a <i>thumbs up</i>. The most upvoted
    questions will be visible to the host and speaker, who will answer (some) of them during the Q&A.
</p>
<p>
    You can also participate in rooms via IRC (Freenode) or XMPP, although upvoting messages isn't yet bridged.  For instance, the Cloud devroom is available on Matrix at
    <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#cloud:fosdem.org">#cloud:fosdem.org</a> but also <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/fosdem-cloud">#fosdem-cloud</a> on Freenode and
    <a href="xmpp://#cloud#fosdem.org@matrix.org?join">xmpp://#cloud#fosdem.org@matrix.org?join</a> on XMPP.
</p>

<a name="stands"></a>
<h4>Stands</h4>
<p>
    The stands have their own website over at <a href="https://stands.fosdem.org"><i>stands.fosdem.org</i></a>. We've organised the stands by a theme
    so they are easier to find.
</p>
<p>
    There is a nice cosy corner for each stand containing of static information (a web page), some prerecorded video's and a chatroom on <a href="https://chat.fosdem.org"><i>chat.fosdem.org</i></a> using the
    same principle as for devrooms.  Stand admins can add a moderated live-stream/video widget by pressing the video call button on chat.fosdem.org to videochat with visitors if they like.
</p>
<p>
    As for devrooms, <b>you do not need an account to visit a stand or watch a video</b>, but you will need a <a href="#chatting">Matrix account</a> if you wish to participate in the discussion.
    There will be someone present in each room from the project team to answer any questions you might have, and some have invited a developer/project leader/ ... to
    provide a hint of the future for their project and to answer any pressing question you might have.
