  FOSDEM welcomes all free software and open source developers! While we
  don't own the university campus and have little control over its
  accessibility, we know there is still significant work to be done to
  make FOSDEM accessible to everyone. We are committed to improving both
  the on site and online experience, and we need the community’s help to
  do that.
</p>

<p>
  For digital participation, our goal is to meet WCAG 2.2 AA, the current
  best open standard for digital accessibility and inclusion. We are not
  there yet, but this is the standard we are actively working toward.
</p>

<p>
  Wheelchair accessible routes and toilets can be found through
  <a href='https://nav.fosdem.org'>nav.fosdem.org</a>
  (hint: search for "wheelchair" and use the "avoid stairs" navigation
  setting). All rooms apart from the upper rooms in AW are wheelchair
  accessible. A static map of the campus is available
  <a href="https://www.ulb.be/fr/accessibilite-pour-tous/amenagements-specifiques">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Licensed guide dogs for the blind only are allowed on campus.
</p>

<p>
  The community should be mindful of the needs of others and ensure that people with disabilities 
  have priority to sit in the front.
</p>

<p>
  We realise some people on the autism spectrum might need some quiet
  time. While we cannot offer a dedicated quiet space on campus, we
  suggest
  <a href='https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/150213167'>Bois de La Cambre/Terkamerenbos</a>,
  only a five minute walk away.
</p>

<h3>Suggestions welcome</h3>
<p>
  Accessibility at FOSDEM is a shared responsibility. If you encounter
  barriers or have ideas for improvements, please let us know so we can
  prioritise what to fix next. You can email
  <a href="mailto:feedback@fosdem.org">feedback@fosdem.org</a>, or propose
  improvements directly by opening issues or pull requests on the
  <a href="https://github.com/FOSDEM/website/">FOSDEM website repository
  on GitHub</a>.
