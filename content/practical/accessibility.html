<p>
  FOSDEM welcomes all free software and open source developers!  While
  we don't own the university campus and have little control over its
  accessibility, we have tried to find ways for developers with
  physical limitations to make the most of the event.
</p>

<p>
  During the event, accessible routes will be signposted with the &#9855;. All
  rooms apart from the upper rooms in AW are weelchair accessible. A map of the
  campus is available <a href="https://www.ulb.be/fr/accessibilite-pour-tous/amenagements-specifiques">here</a>.
