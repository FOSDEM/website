<p>
  FOSDEM welcomes all free software and open source developers!  While
  we don't own the university campus and have little control over its
  accessibility, we have tried to find ways for developers with
  physical limitations to make the most of the event.
</p>

<p>
  Wheelchair accessible routes and toilets can be found through <a href='https://nav.fosdem.org'>nav.fosdem.org</a> (hint: search for "wheelchair" and use the "avoid stairs" navigation setting). All rooms apart from the upper rooms in AW are weelchair accessible. A static map of the campus is available <a href="https://www.ulb.be/fr/accessibilite-pour-tous/amenagements-specifiques">here</a>.
