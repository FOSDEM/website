<p>
While coming over to Brussels to attend FOSDEM, don’t miss this great
opportunity to taste some of the finest
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belgian_beer">beer in Belgium</a>
(and hence in the world).
</p>

<h2>When?</h2>

<p>
  <span title="<%= (days.first[:conference_day] - 1).strftime("%Y-%m-%d") %>"
    class="dtstart">
    <%= (days.first[:conference_day] - 1).strftime("%A, %e %B %Y") %>
  </span>
  from 18:00(-ish) onwards, but feel free to join the party at any time of the
  evening.
  We will be there until the bar closes (well after midnight).
</p>

<h2>Beer, Beer and some more Beer</h2>
<p>
  This year’s beer event will again take place at the
  <a href="http://www.deliriumcafe.be/">Delirium Caf&eacute;</a>,
  in a beautiful alley near the
  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Place">Grand Place</a>
  in Brussels.
  In addition to the
  <a href="http://www.deliriumcafe.be/carte/?lang=en">enormous variety in
    beers</a>,
  the location also has enough room to accommodate the vast crowd of geeks we
  tend to be.
</p>

<p>
  There are 25 different draught beers available.
  In addition to these, there is a cellar full of regular and specialty bottled
  beer.
  The <a href="http://deliriumcafe.be/categorylisting/">beer menu</a> on the
  bar’s website, while always out of date, is a good indication of the wide
  selection available.
</p>

<h2>Beer Distribution Algorithm v3.2 (stable)</h2>

<p>
  After about ten years of incremental improvements to our notorious Beer
  Distribution Algorithm, we appear to have reached a stable version with the
  algorithm used: v3.2.
  We have no changes to the algorithm to announce this year, at least up to
  now&mdash;if we change our mind, we will let you know you in time.
</p>

<h2>Security measures / access control</h2>
<p>
  We have reserved the ground floor of the bar as a private party for FOSDEM.
  The Delirium Caf&eacute; has offered us an extra room so we will be able to
  move around a bit easier.
  Delirium Security will help us keep this area FOSDEM-only.
  If you meet a guard at the entrance to the bar, make it clear to him that you
  are there for the FOSDEM party.
  Wearing appropriately geeky attire tends to do the trick, as does mentioning
  the name FOSDEM.
</p>

<h2>Beer Tokens</h2>
<p>
  Tokens are &euro;3 each.
  One token, one beer.
  For the sake of simplicity, “soda” (cola, lemonade, etc) is beer too&mdash;at
  least as far as tokens are concerned.
  Tokens may be bought individually, but FOSDEM staff prefers to deal with paper
  money rather than metal money.
  It’s lighter and easier to sort.
</p>

<p>
  When you arrive at the bar, find a member of FOSDEM staff (look for flashy
  yellow and orange tshirts).
  In exchange for money, you will receive “beer tokens”.
</p>

<h2>Free Beer!</h2>
<p>
  We will continue to offer the tradition of Free Beer!
  To ensure a fair distribution of Free Beer, and not just a bulk distribution
  to early birds or similar, Free Beer will be distributed periodically
  throughout the evening until it runs out.
</p>

<h2>Quality of Service</h2>
<p>
  To keep latencies low and throughput high, we need everyone’s help.
  The easiest way to keep things going smoothly is for everyone to implement a
  transmit and receive window.
  Do not order individual beers&mdash;order beers for people around you too!
  Trays will be made available to efficiently move more than one beer from the
  bar to where they are needed.
  Similarly, when ordering beer, please take a moment to collect any empty
  glasses around you on a tray and send them back to be bar with whoever is
  ordering beer.
</p>

<p>
  The Delirium Caf&eacute; staff is working hard to make our evening as pleasant
  as possible, but we’re legion.
</p>

<h2>Laws of Physics</h2>
<p>
  Sadly, even the FOSDEM Beer Event is subject to the fundamental laws of
  physics.
  We were unable to get an exception for the principle that no two solid objects
  can occupy the same space at the same time.
  If you find the bar getting too crowded, it might help to go for dinner and
  come back later.
  The bar will be open until 06:00 (that’s 6am to intercontinental geeks).
  While FOSDEM staff will stop distributing tokens sometime after midnight (we
  have a conference to set up early in the morning), the tokens will be valid
  all night and after tokens run out, beer can be exchanged directly for cash
  too (same price).
</p>

<h2>A note of caution</h2>
<p>
  Unlike some other beers, Belgian beer is not just coloured water.
  Some beers contain significant quantities of alcohol and <em>will</em> give
  you a pounding hangover (as a side note, consuming lots of (pure) water helps
  preventing that).
  FOSDEM staff is not responsible for any hallucinations you may experience as a
  result of this event. <code>:-)</code>
</p>

<h2>Be there!</h2>
<p>
  A lot of work has gone into making this beer event the best ever.
  We’ve taken into account the suggestions from previous years and are confident
  that this edition will be a blast.
  Bring your friends and join us for a great evening out as well as a great
  opportunity to socialise with fellow contributors from all around the world.
</p>

<h2>Contact and location</h2>
<p>
  If you manage to get lost somehow, despite this handy little map, <a
  href="http://blog.sejo.be/about/">call Jochen</a>.
  He might not be able to help you find the way, but he should be able to find
  someone who can!  <code>:-)</code>
