<p>
  Starting in 2009, FOSDEM has hired professional guides each year to offer free
  guided tours of Brussels to the spouses/partners of FOSDEM visitors.
  If your partner would like to accompany you to Brussels but is not interested
  in the FOSDEM conference, this will make their stay worthwhile.
  Brussels has a rich historical past and a cosmopolitan present.
</p>

<p>
  The <em>free tours</em> will take place on both afternoons of the conference.
  Each tour will give you a view of a different part of the city, and the tours
  offered this year will be different from those offered in previous years.
  The guides will gather participants at a meeting point on the Solbosch campus
  (where exactly is yet to be announced), and every tour ends there as well.
