<p>
  In order to keep FOSDEM a fun, interesting and positive experience for
  everybody, we expect participants to follow our guidelines:
</p>

<p>
  FOSDEM aims to be a free, open and cooperative event. This means we
  expect collaboration from all the FOSDEM participants, and for
  everybody to behave respectfully towards all others, including those
  that are different or think differently from themselves.
</p>

<p>
  Please be helpful, considerate, friendly, and respectful towards all
  other participants and respect the environment. We don't condone
  harassment or offensive behaviour at our conference. We consider it
  against our values as human beings. We're voicing our strong,
  unequivocal support of exemplary behaviour by all participants.
</p>

<p>
  Please remember that all FOSDEM participants are here by invitation of
  the conference organisers and the ULB. We expect all participants to
  follow this Code of Conduct during the conference and related events.
  This includes conference-related social events at off-site locations,
  and in related online communities and on social media. Participants
  asked to stop a particular behaviour by staff are expected to comply
  immediately. Conference participants violating this Code of Conduct
  may be expelled from the conference and/or banned from formal
  participation in future events.
</p>

<p>
  Please bring any concerns to the immediate attention of our
  coordinating team (contact details below).
</p>

<p>
  Thank you for your help in making FOSDEM a success and pleasant for
  all the people involved.
